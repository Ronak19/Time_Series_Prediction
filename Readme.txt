Steps:
1. Run the code and look for the 'J' vs 'no. of iterations' graph and the created regression model. Close both the figures.
2. After creating the model it predicts for y(n+1), y(n+2), ...., y(n+30) and asks for the xlsx file name (This file has to be in the same format as the one which was given to us for training data)
3. Once the test file is compared with the predicted results it shows the percent error of the predicted data.
